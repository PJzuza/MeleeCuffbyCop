## What does this mod do?  
- Give a chance around 20% that a player will get cuffed by any cops when they use a melee attack.  
- If you got tased and then got meleed too then you can get cuffed instantly.  
- Only Counterstrike skill that can help you prevent getting cuffed. (for now)  
- The original idea came from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/63mjd8/anyone_else_want_cops_to_attempt_to_handcuff_more/)
