Thing I still have to do
	* Fixed some serious bugs. (auto counter, no timer if you got cuffed while you got tased at the same time, auto counter is cheating to me... though I am trying to fix it)
	* Exclude some types of enemies and special enemies like Dozer, Taser, Sniper, Shield may be...
	* Make it works both client side and a host side. (now it works only if you have this mod)
	* I may add an option to enable-disable this mod.
	* I may add a voice line (Voice ID: "i03" that cop says "It's over", "This ends now", "Scumbag") considered it as a tuant.
	* If possible I may chance the lib/units/enemies/cop/logics/coplogicarrest like more than 1 cop can perform an action or when a player got flashed then cops will charge at a player to cuff him/her.
	* Repolish my shitty coding :P 
	* Some other things I guess... gonna try harder with my shitty coding skill...
Note- This is my second mod so as you can see, It's still buggy as fuc* 
	- If anyone wants to help, please do since my coding skill is so fuck** up. Send me a pull request so I can check and push it at my Github.
